Build a complete, production-ready full-stack web application called Kwara Billboard Analytics Portal. It must be fully functional, not placeholder or dummy. Use real architectures, real code, real components, and real Supabase integration. The goal is to create a system for the Kwara State Signage Agency that:

Counts the number of people passing in front of a billboard (via uploaded videos using an AI model).

Provides an admin portal to manage billboard locations and view analytics.

Provides a public portal for citizens/advertisers to view available billboard locations and traffic data.

📌 TECH STACK REQUIREMENTS

Use the following stack:

Frontend: React + Vite + TailwindCSS

Backend: Node.js (Express)

Database + Auth: Supabase

AI Processing: Python service using Ultralytics YOLOv8 or YOLOv11 for people detection

Hosting: Entire project must be deployable on Render, including backend, frontend, and AI microservice

Storage: Supabase storage for storing uploaded videos

Map: LeafletJS (OpenStreetMap)

Charting: Chart.js or Recharts

Branding: Use Kwara State Government Logo (placeholder local file, not dummy), favicon, official Kwara green (#0AA344)

🚀 FEATURES TO BUILD

Button: “Request This Billboard”

A contact form that saves to Supabase (table: requests)

2️⃣ ADMIN PORTAL (LOGIN REQUIRED)

Path: /admin

Authentication using Supabase email/password.

Admin can:

Add/edit/delete billboard locations

Upload billboard images

Upload CCTV or phone videos for analysis

Trigger AI detection endpoint

View analytics dashboards:

People count from each video

Trend charts

Total daily views

Weekly/monthly comparisons

Export analytics as CSV

See booking requests from public users

Admin Dashboard UI:

Sidebar navigation

Charts

Table of all billboards

Table of all analytics results

Kwara State logo on top-left

Favicon included

Modern UI with TailwindCSS

🧠 AI VIDEO PROCESSING SERVICE

Create a separate folder /ai-service containing:

Python FastAPI server

Endpoint: /analyze

Accepts video URL from Supabase storage

Downloads video

Runs YOLOv8/YOLOv11 person detection

Counts unique frames with people

Returns:

{
  "total_people": 123,
  "video_duration": "...",
  "frames_processed": 1000
}


Save result to Supabase table analytics

This service must be deployable as a separate Render service.

🗂️ DATABASE SCHEMA (Supabase)

Create these tables:

Smooth animations

Clean fonts (Inter or Poppins)

🏁 DEPLOYMENT REQUIREMENTS

Produce a full project with:

/frontend → React app

/backend → Node Express API

/ai-service → Python FastAPI AI server

Add render.yaml or deployment instructions

All environment variables must be loaded from .env

No placeholder code. Everything must be real and working.

Use production-ready security and file structure.

📦 DELIVERABLE

Generate the entire project source code, with real functional integration, no placeholders, ready to be pushed to GitHub and deployed on Render.
